Create git repository locally

We need to add a repository for your project. Git is a distributed version control system, so each machine has its own repository. 
This is different to centralised version control systems like Subversion, which have a single, central, repository.

Go to your project

$ cd my_project

Initialise the repository

$ git init

You should see the following message:

Initialized empty Git repository in /path/to/my_project/.git/

Add all your files to the repo:

$ git add *

Check to see that there are changes to be committed:

$ git status

You should see something like this:

# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
#
#   new file:   my_project.info
#   new file:   my_project.module
#

In this case, my_project.info and my_project.module are the files I have in my project.

Commit the files.

$ git commit -m "First commit"

You should see something like this:

[master (root-commit) 8201309] First commit
 2 files changed, 74 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 my_project.info
 create mode 100644 my_project.module


Add this as the remote origin:

 $ git remote add origin https://github.com/yourname/my_project.git

Pull from Github to local:

$ git pull origin master

And finally, push the code to Github:

$ git push origin master

You should see something like this:

Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.

To https://github.com/yourname/my_project.git
 ba2316b..3dae654  master -> master

That is all there is to it! Now your project is under version control and public on Github.
